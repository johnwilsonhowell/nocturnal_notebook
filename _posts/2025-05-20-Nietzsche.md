## Essay on Nietzsche

Reading the enigmatic Nietzsche is a rewarding journey. He can see far beyond his own time. He foresaw the collapse of certainty in our values that characterized the 20th century. He experienced the effects of Nihilism. Nietzsche was wrong about the cure, but not because he didn't comprehend the enormity of the danger. But his questions are his greatest contribution. Nietzsche is said to philosophize with a hammer, and his hammers are the questions that he uses to strike at the bedrock of Western thought. This is no theoretical love tap; it is a deathly serious challenge to everything that has supported the Western civilization that we all depend on. Though Nieszche's questions are dangerous, we need to confront them. You can learn the answers by understanding his train of thought and where he got off track. You should confront Nietzche's hammer to develop a stronger and more resilient mind. 



Nietzsche is a dangerous prophet. He predicted the rise of Nihilism. He writes in The Will to Power, "What I relate is the history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what is inevitable: the rise of Nihilism. This tale can already be told, for necessity itself is a work here." By necessity, he means that these future events are certain because the forces at work require that these events take place. He further describes his prophetic ability. "As the first perfect European nihilist, but as one who has already outlived the nihilism he contains within himself." He is living ahead of his time and has already gone beyond the Nihilism that will shadow Europe and us today. He writes extensively about what comes after Nihilism. He writes, "Because we must first experience nihilism before we can determine what these 'values' were actually worth." Once they are gone, we will know the value of our old beliefs. He observes very well, and these observations lead him to devise a way out of Nihilism. Somewhat ominously, he writes, "Sooner or later we shall stand in need of new values…"



Nietzsche saw the storm on the horizon. He was confused about how one was to endure it, but in his confusion, there were inklings of the way forward. Observe part of the progression of Nietzsche's ideas at the beginning of The Will to Power, "Nihilism: there is no goal, no answer to the question: why? What is the significance of Nihilism? – that the highest values devalue themselves." Right. "Radical nihilism is the conviction that existence itself is absolutely indefensible," Right. "The insight [that existence itself is absolutely indefensible] is a consequence of a carefully cultivated sense of 'truthfulness', which is itself a consequence of the belief in morality." Wrong. But see how far he got before he went down the wrong trail. He gave an accurate definition of Nihilism in order to show how Christian morals led to Nihilism. He gives answers for why he doesn't believe truthfulness is always good. He has many insights, though he ultimately strays from the truth and misleads us. His observations and insights are valuable even if his philosophy is not. You need to think along with Nietzsche to benefit from his writings. Don't outsource your thoughts to him. What are your answers to his existential attacks?



Nietzsche is philosophy's great antagonist and leveller. Questions are his hammer. The questions he asks are fundamental and radical. He writes, "Granted that we want the truth: Why not rather untruth?" Why not? We axiomatically believe that truth is desirable. He asks if some falsehoods are essential to our survival. He questions the validity of abstract notions like numbers and Platonic forms. Are these necessary falsehoods? Can we get rid of them? Stirring questions that have an impact on every part of our lives. Nietzsche shakes the foundations of ideas. With him, we examine ancient axioms that were laid long ago. We need to learn why these foundations are there if we want to keep them.



"Why" is what Nietzsche is always saying. His philosophy is not systematic. He poetically questions and hypothesizes. He is a personal confidant, not a lecturer. He shows you the strange things he has seen. His beliefs are not the important part. The most important thing about reading Nietzsche is personally wrestling with his ideas. Nietzsche encourages you to do so and never avoids being questioned. He writes, "Granted that this also is only interpretation–and you will be eager enough to make this objection?–well, so much the better." Don't take his writings as a lecture but as an adventure. "And there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has once drifted hither with one's bark, well! Very good! Now let us set our teeth firmly!" As to his warning, I believe that the rewards outweigh the personal dangers of reading Nietzsche. Though often wrong, his questions, insights, and explorative spirit are vital to developing a strong and resilient mind that can stand up to the storm of this age. That is why one must confront Nietzsche.
