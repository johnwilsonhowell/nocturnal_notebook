title: An Essay On Pride and Prejudice *Spoilers*
---

_An essay I wrote after reading Pride and Prejudice using the very helpful essay guide by Jordan B Peterson. **Spoilers**_

## Did Darcy make a good choice in marrying Elizabeth? 
It is needless to say that all the characters in Pride and Prejudice are full of life and incredibly interesting, but no one is quite as engaging as Darcy or Elizabeth. There would be no Pride and Prejudice without them, but while they will always share a book together, did Darcy make the right decision in choosing Elizabeth to be his lawfully wedded wife?

Darcy is twenty eight years old in the book (P&P p. 259), and this is a good age to find a wife. (Mary Fetzer) There are good reasons why he should marry. City Journal lists a few such as better mental health, financial gains, and a stable romantic relationship. (Maggie Gallagher, 2000) And it was expected of men to have a family.

But above all these, if you want to have children you need to be married. He needs a child to pass off the estate to. Children need a stable mother and father. So above all, Darcy needs to marry a good mother.

A mother is loving (Dachelle). She embodies feminine care. A delicate, and gentle care. One may notice how much this sounds like Jane. She embodies these traits. Elizabeth is a little more complicated. She is independent, and thoughtful. She is clever, and fun to be around. I don’t believe one would describe the ideal mother as fun, and clever. Though I am certain that Elizabeth is caring and loving, I don’t believe that she is as motherly as Jane. And good mothers are good wives. 

But there were other drawbacks to marrying Elizabeth. She was a risky choice. As the wife of Darcy, she would have responsibilities. Elizabeth would have to become accustomed to new social circles. She would need to learn the ropes, and become a competent matron of a large household with no prior experience. I believe that Darcy had other good options, as far as a wife. Miss De Bourgh is one. Lady Catherine intended for Darcy to marry her daughter. This arrangement would raise him into the aristocracy.

Over all, Elizabeth has something strikes against her. She is neither as motherly as Jane, nor as high-born as Miss De Bourgh, and Darcy didn’t need to marry her to enjoy her company. But though Darcy knew that a match between them looked bad on paper, he saw something in her that he couldn’t afford to lose. He undoubtedly secured a remarkable partner.
